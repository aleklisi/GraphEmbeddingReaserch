in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the third day
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven
and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold
and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof
and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden
and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou
and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the mother of all living
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brothers keeper
and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand
when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle
and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him
male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness and after his image and called his name seth
and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos
and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan
and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel
and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he died
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat enoch
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years
and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son
and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord hath cursed
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark
they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained
and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried
and god spake unto noah saying
go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him
every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar
and the lord smelled a sweet savor and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man
whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying
and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you
and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations
i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud
and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth overspread
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the city rehoboth and calah
and resen between nineveh and calah the same is a great city
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and caphtorim
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth
and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite
and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite
and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboim even unto lasha
these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud and aram
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was joktan
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah
and hadoram and uzal and diklah
and obal and abimael and sheba
and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east
these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations
these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do
go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood

and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah
but sarai was barren she had no child
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons son and sarai his daughter in law his son abrams wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that i will show thee
and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing
and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon
therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai
unto the place of the altar which he had make there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward
for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations
that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaim in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim
and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim
with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five
and the vale of siddim was full of slime pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way
and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the kings dale
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth
and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich
save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it
and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not
and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses abram drove them away
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years
and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates
the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites
and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaim
and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites
now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai
and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur
and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me
wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his sons name which hagar bare ishmael
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram
and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear
and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee
and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground
and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant
let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree
and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also
and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old
is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous
i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein
that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right
and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for fortys sake
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twentys sake
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for tens sake
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground
and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter
and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him
and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place
for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord
behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord
and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a mans wife
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing
and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sake
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac
and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight because of his son
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest
now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned
and abraham said i will swear
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelechs servants had violently taken away
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves
and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time
and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son
that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba
and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor
huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram
and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor abrahams brother
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying
i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar
that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying
nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him
my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest
and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again
the lord god of heaven which took me from my fathers house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in
and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my masters brethren
and the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these things
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the mens feet that were with him
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on
and he said i am abrahams servant
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses
and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink
and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my masters son
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter unto his son
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken
and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master
and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done
and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mothers death
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country
and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre
the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi
now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham
and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam
and mishma and dumah and massa
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah
these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren
and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham begat isaac
and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian
and isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was entreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived
and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the lord
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but rebekah loved jacob
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint
and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me
and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his birthright
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of
sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
and isaac dwelt in gerar
and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she was fair to look upon
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great
for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines envied him
for all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them
and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaacs herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land
and he went up from thence to beersheba
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaacs servants digged a well
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you
and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee
that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace
and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite
which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death
now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison
and make me savory meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying
bring me venison and make me savory meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savory meat for thy father such as he loveth
and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man
my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savory meat such as his father loved
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savory meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son
and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands so he blessed him
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine
let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting
and he also had made savory meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me
and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son
and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above
and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee
now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran
and tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn away
until thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day
and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me
and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mothers brother
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people
and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus mother
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram
and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father
then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on
so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then shall the lord be my god
and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouth
and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they said of haran are we
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept them
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept
and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be
and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favored
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die
and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan
and bilhah rachels maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife
and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a son
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad
and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a second son
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach
and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favor in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstreaked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree and pilled white streaks in them and made the white appear which was in the rods
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstreaked speckled and spotted
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto labans cattle
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses
and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock
and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstreaked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstreaked
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstreaked speckled and grizzled
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstreaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house
are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her fathers
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount gilead
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods
and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them
and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed
and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee
this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him
and when jacob saw them he said this is gods host and he called the name of that place mahanaim
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now
and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands
and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother
two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee
then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundred pieces of money
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised
then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone
and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was more honorable than all the house of his father
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying
these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city
and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went out
the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister
they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field
and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house
and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house
and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot
and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother
then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments
and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went
and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem
and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob
so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is bethel he and all the people that were with him
and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother
but deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth
and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him
and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel
and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins
and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel
and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labor
and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also
and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name benoni but his father called him benjamin
and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is bethlehem
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of rachels grave unto this day
and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar
and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his fathers concubine and israel heard it now the sons of jacob were twelve
the sons of leah reuben jacobs firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun
the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin
and the sons of bilhah rachels handmaid dan and naphtali
and the sons of zilpah leahs handmaid gad and asher these are the sons of jacob which were born to him in padanaram
and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre unto the city of arba which is hebron where abraham and isaac sojourned
and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years
and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried him

esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and aholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite

and esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the persons of his house and his cattle and all his beasts and all his substance which he had got in the land of canaan and went into the country from the face of his brother jacob
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle

these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him
and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more
and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed
for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf
and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words
and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me
and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth
and his brethren envied him but his father observed the saying
and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem
and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i
and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem
and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou
and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed their flocks
and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan
and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him
and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh
come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams
and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him
and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again
and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him
and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it
and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt
and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood
come and let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content
then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt
and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes
and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and i whither shall i go
and they took josephs coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood
and they sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy sons coat or no
and he knew it and said it is my sons coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces
and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs and captain of the guard
and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shuah and he took her and went in unto her
and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er
and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan
and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar
and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him
and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother
and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him also
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judahs wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite
and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep
and she put her widows garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife
when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her face
and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me
and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it
and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her not
then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this place
and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place
and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her
and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt
when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff
and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more
and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb
and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first
and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez
and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zarah
and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down thither
and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian
and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand
and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field
and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favored
and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me
but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand
there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god
and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her
and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within
and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out
and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth
that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice
and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out
and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home
and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me
and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out
and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled
and josephs master took him and put him into the prison a place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison
but the lord was with joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison
and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper
and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward
and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the prison
and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad
and he asked pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward of his lords house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day
and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them i pray you
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me
and in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes
and pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand
and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and show kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three white baskets on my head
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head
and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee
and it came to pass the third day which was pharaohs birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand
but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven well favored kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favored and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
and the ill favored and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine so pharaoh awoke
and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day
pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret
and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it
and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favored and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favored and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness
and the lean and the ill favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favored as at the beginning so i awoke
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good
and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god hath showed pharaoh what he is about to do
the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one
and the seven thin and ill favored kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he showeth unto pharaoh
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants
and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is
and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art
thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou
and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt
and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house
and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction
and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended
and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread
and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all lands
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another
and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die
and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt
but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan
and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth
and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food
and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come
we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spies
and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not
and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies
hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither
send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies
and he put them all together into ward three days
and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god
if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses
but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so
and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us
and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required
and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter
and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them
and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouth
and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying
the man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country
and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies
we be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan
and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone
and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffic in the land
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid
and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me
and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again
and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
and the famine was sore in the land
and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food
and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food
but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother
and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down
and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever
for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time
and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds
and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight
take also your brother and arise go again unto the man
and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved
and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph
and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon
and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into josephs house
and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses
and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they communed with him at the door of the house
and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food
and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks
and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them
and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth
and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive
and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance
and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mothers son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son
and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there
and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread
and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians
and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marveled one at another
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him
and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouth
and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses
and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing
and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words
and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lords bondmen
and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack
and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamins sack
then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city
and judah and his brethren came to josephs house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground
and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine
and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lords servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found
and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father
then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh
my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother
and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him
and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord
and our father said go again and buy us a little food
and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face except our youngest brother be with us
and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons
and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since
and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life
it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever
now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren
for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father
then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren
and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard
and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence
and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life
for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance
so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast
and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither
and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck
moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants
and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan
and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land
now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come
also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours
and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment
and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way
so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way
and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father
and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacobs heart fainted for he believed them not
and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived
and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die
and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i
and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation
i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes
and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him
and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him
his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt
and these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn
and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and carmi
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman
and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari
and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and pharez and zarah but er and onan died in the land of canaan and the sons of pharez were hezron and hamul

and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into egypt were threescore and ten
and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen
and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while
and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive
and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house i will go up and show pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my fathers house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me
and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation
that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians
then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen
and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathers
they said moreover unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee
the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou
and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage
and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh
and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded
and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his fathers household with bread according to their families
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house
and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth
and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail
and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaohs
and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof
only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands
then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land
and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones
and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not pharaohs
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt
but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said
and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the beds head
and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim
and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed
and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me
and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession
and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine
and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same is bethlehem
and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these
and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them
and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath showed me also thy seed
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near unto him
and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn
and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day
the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head
and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations
and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh
and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow
and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days
gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father
reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power
unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch
simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel
judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down before thee
judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up
the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be
binding his foal unto the vine and his asss colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes
his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute
dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel
dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward
i have waited for thy salvation o lord
gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last
out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties
naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words
joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall
the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him
but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of israel
even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the womb
the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
benjamin shall raven as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them
and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite
in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people
and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel
and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days
and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying
my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again
and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear
and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt
and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days
and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which is beyond jordan
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre
and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father
and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him
and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying
so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants
and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god
but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive
now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them
and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and joseph lived an hundred and ten years
and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon josephs knees
and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence
so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt
